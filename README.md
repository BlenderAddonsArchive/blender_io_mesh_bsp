# Quake 1 BSP Importer for Blender
A simple Blender addon that imports Quake BSP files, including textures as materials.
Thanks to a couple of contributions by others, notably Ian Cunningham, it works with
current versions of Blender (2.75) and supports the creation of Cycles materials and
importing lights if they haven't been stripped from the BSP.
